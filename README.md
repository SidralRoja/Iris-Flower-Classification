# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):

Length of the sepals/n
Length of the sepals

Width of the sepals

Length of the petals
Width of the petalsr.

Width of the petals.
